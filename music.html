        <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>
            Hindustani classical music is the classical music of northern regions of the Indian subcontinent.
            It may also be called North Indian classical music or, in Hindustani, Shastriya Sangeet.
            Its origins date from the 12th century CE, when it diverged from
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music">Carnatic music</a>, the classical tradition
            of southern regions of the Indian subcontinent.
        </p>
        <p>
            The rhythmic organization is based on rhythmic patterns called tala.
            The melodic foundations are called ragas. One possible classification of
            ragas is into "melodic modes" or "parent scales", known as thaats, under which
            most ragas can be classified based on the notes they use.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three main 'Saptak' which resemble to the 'Octaves' in Western Music
            except they characterize total seven notes or 'swaras' instead of eight.
            These are- low (mandra), medium (madhya) and high (tāra).
            Each octave resonates with a certain part of the body, low octave in the heart,
            medium octave in the throat and high octave in the head.

        <h4 id="concepts"><strong>BASIC CONCEPTS</strong></h4>
        <P>
            The difference between sargam and solfege is that re, ga, ma, dha, and ni can refer to either
            "Natural" (shuddha) or altered "Flat" (komal) or "Sharp" (teevra) versions of their respective
            scale degrees. As with movable do solfege, the notes are heard relative to an arbitrary tonic
            that varies from performance to performance, rather than to fixed frequencies, as on a xylophone.
            The fine intonational differences between different instances of the same swara are called srutis.
            The three primary registers of Indian classical music are mandra (lower), madhya (middle) and
            taar (upper). Since the octave location is not fixed, it is also possible to use provenances in
            mid-register (such as mandra-madhya or madhya-taar) for certain ragas. A typical rendition of
            Hindustani raga involves two stages:
        </P>
        <ul>
            <Li>Alap: a rhythmically free improvisation on the rules for the raga in order to give life
                to the raga and flesh out its characteristics. The alap is followed by a long slow-tempo
                improvisation in vocal music, or by the jod and jhala in instrumental music.
                Tans are of several types like Shuddha, Jabda, Murki, etc.</Li>
            <Li>Bandish or Gat: a fixed, melodic composition set in a specific raga, performed with
                rhythmic accompaniment by a tabla or pakhavaj. There are different ways of systematizing
                the parts of a composition. For example:</Li>
            <ul type=circle>
                <Li>Sthaayi: The initial, rondo phrase or line of a fixed, melodic composition</Li>
                <Li>Antara: The first body phrase or line of a fixed, melodic composition</Li>
                <Li>Sanchaari: The third body phrase or line of a fixed, melodic composition,
                    seen more typically in dhrupad bandishes</Li>
            </ul>
            <Li>There are three variations of bandish, regarding tempo:</Li>
            <ul type=circle>
                <li>Vilambit bandish: A slow and steady melodic composition, usually in largo to adagio speeds</li>
                <li>Madhyalaya bandish: A medium tempo melodic composition, usually set in andante to allegretto speeds
                </li>
                <li>Drut bandish: A fast tempo melodic composition, usually set to allegretto speed or faster</li>
            </ul>

        <P>The alap gradually unfolds into more rhythmic jod and jhala sections. These sections are followed by a
            rendition of bandish, with the pakhawaj as an accompaniment. The great Indian musician Tansen sang in the
            dhrupad style. A lighter form of dhrupad called dhamar, is sung primarily during the spring festival of
            Holi.

            Dhrupad was the main form of northern Indian classical music until two centuries ago when it gave way to the
            somewhat less austere khyal, a more free-form style of singing. Since losing its main patrons among the
            royalty in Indian princely states, dhrupad risked becoming extinct in the first half of the twentieth
            century. However, the efforts by a few proponents, especially from the Dagar family, have led to its
            revival.

            Some of the best known vocalists who sing in the Dhrupad style are the members of the Dagar lineage,
            including the senior Dagar brothers, Nasir Moinuddin and Nasir Aminuddin Dagar; the junior Dagar brothers,
            Nasir Zahiruddin and Nasir Faiyazuddin Dagar; and Wasifuddin, Fariduddin, and Sayeeduddin Dagar. Other
            leading exponents include the Gundecha Brothers and Uday Bhawalkar, who have received training from some of
            the Dagars. Leading vocalists outside the Dagar lineage include the Mallik family of Darbhanga tradition of
            musicians; some of the leading exponents of this tradition were Ram Chatur Mallick, Siyaram Tiwari, and
            Vidur Mallick. At present Prem Kumar Mallick, Prashant and Nishant Mallick are the Dhrupad vocalists of this
            tradition.

            A section of dhrupad singers of Delhi Gharana from Mughal emperor Shah Jahan's court migrated to Bettiah
            under the patronage of the Bettiah Raj, giving rise to the Bettiah Gharana</P>

            Although Hindustani music clearly is focused on vocal performance, instrumental forms have existed since
            ancient times.
            In fact, in recent decades, especially outside South Asia, instrumental Hindustani music is more popular
            than vocal music,
            partly due to a somewhat different style and faster tempo, and partly because of a language barrier for the
            lyrics in
            vocal music.A number of musical instruments are associated with Hindustani classical music.
            The veena, a string instrument, was traditionally regarded as the most important, but few play it today
            and it has largely been superseded by its cousins the sitar and the sarod, both of which owe their origin to
            Persian influences. Among bowed instruments, the sarangi and violin are popular. The bansuri, shehnai and
            harmonium
            are important wind instruments. In the percussion ensemble, the tabla and the pakhavaj are the most popular.
            Rarely used plucked or struck string instruments include the surbahar, sursringar, santoor, and various
            versions of the
            slide guitar. Various other instruments have also been used in varying degrees.
